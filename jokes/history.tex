\item I've never been strong with history. I know the basics. The United States has presidents, England has kings but they don't king anything anymore, and Hitler was a really bad guy. I think he died in the war? I bet the guy who killed him was a pretty great. Not that killing is a good thing, I realize it's a last resort, but it seems hard not to say that the guy who killed Hitler is a hero.
