Hi, I'm starting to stand-up. I've started this git repository to
track my jokes (/jokes/*.tex) and my sets, so I can have a complete
picture of how they change over time as I perform them. I'll also be
able to see how my sets change: which jokes are kept or removed, and
how the order changes.

By using diff and commit messages, I hope to have an entire history of
how and why each joke and set changed.
